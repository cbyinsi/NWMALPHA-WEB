    <p class="muted">Effective date: August 12, 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>FurMeal Log</strong> (the "App"). Your privacy is important to us.

      <li>Device information: device model, operating system version, app version, and unique device identifiers.</li>
      <li>Crash and diagnostic data to help us identify and fix bugs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Cookies and Similar Technologies</h3>
    <p>We may use cookies, local storage, and similar technologies to store preferences and analytics data. These technologies do not typically contain personal information unless you provide it.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the App and its features.</li>
      <li>Personalize your experience (for example, saving pet profiles and preferences).</li>
      <li>Respond to comments, questions, and support requests.</li>
      <li>Monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve the App's performance and design.</li>
      <li>Detect, prevent, and address technical issues or abuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We will not sell your personal information. We may disclose information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> We may share data with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf (e.g., analytics, crash reporting, cloud storage). These providers are contractually limited to using the data only as necessary to provide their services.</li>

    <p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. If you delete your account, we will delete or anonymize your personal data within a reasonable timeframe, except for data we are required to retain for legal or legitimate business purposes.</p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect personal information. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. If we learn of a security breach affecting personal data, we will take steps to investigate and, where appropriate, notify affected users and authorities.</p>
